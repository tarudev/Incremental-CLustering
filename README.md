# Incremental-Clustering
Implemented the Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm of K-Means Clustering incrementally, improving resource utilization in terms of speed and space. Used OpenMP Library to design a parallelized, multithreaded model in a Shared Memory Distribution System further increasing the speed of execution.
